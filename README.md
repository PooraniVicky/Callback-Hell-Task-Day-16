*Callback Hell Task: Advance wishes for Independence Day*

This task demonstrates handling asynchronous operations using callbacks and setTimeout to wish in advance a Happy Independence Day. The code simulates a scenario where multiple asynchronous tasks are nested, resulting in what is commonly referred to as "callback hell."

### Task Description:
- *Objective*: To wish in advance a Happy Independence Day using nested asynchronous callbacks.
- *Implementation*: JavaScript's setTimeout function is utilized to simulate asynchronous operations, creating nested callbacks to demonstrate the callback hell scenario.
- *Independence Day Wishes*: The message "Happy Independence Day!" is displayed after each asynchronous operation is completed.
